# Book Inventory Manager for Ring Savvy

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project will allow a user to return information about a book and add it to a books list. 
It will do so through use of the [OpenLibrary API.](element)

The user is able to view the title, author, average rating, cover, and ISBN of these entries.
They can be created with the first text input field, and removed with the second.

```
